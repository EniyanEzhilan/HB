#  Real-Time Shoplifting Detection using Pose Estimation and Machine Learning

This project is a part of my internship, aimed at building a real-time suspicious behavior detection system using surveillance footage. The focus is on detecting **shoplifting behavior** by combining **YOLOv8-based pose estimation** with **XGBoost classification**. The system tracks people, analyzes their movement and body keypoints, and flags any potentially suspicious activity in live or recorded video streams.

##  Project Structure

```bash
HB/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset_path/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Normal/               # Cropped person images (normal behavior)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Suspicious/           # Cropped person images (suspicious behavior)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dataset.csv           # Final labeled keypoint dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ images/                   # Full video frames (for reference)
â”œâ”€â”€ images1/                  # Temporary cropped people (emptied later)
â”œâ”€â”€ vid.mp4                   # Input video file
â”œâ”€â”€ output_vid.mp4            # Final annotated output video
â”œâ”€â”€ output_blurred.mp4        # Optional blurred video from GUI
â”œâ”€â”€ nkeypoint.csv             # Raw keypoints from all detections
â”œâ”€â”€ trained_model.json        # Trained XGBoost model
â”œâ”€â”€ tksoft.py                 # GUI tool to blur selected people in a video
â”œâ”€â”€ normal.py                 # Extracts keypoints from normal-only video
â”œâ”€â”€ Suspicious.py             # Extracts keypoints from suspicious-only video
â”œâ”€â”€ ImageShuffle.py           # Moves images into Normal/Suspicious folders
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.py                # Labels keypoints as Normal/Suspicious
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py                  # Trains XGBoost model on keypoint data
â””â”€â”€ main.py                   # Final pipeline for real-time shoplifting detection
```

##  How It Works

### 1. **Blurring (tksoft.py)**  
Interactive GUI lets you blur selected people by tracking IDs and create two filtered videos:  
- `normal_video.mp4`: shows only normal activity  
- `sus_video.mp4`: shows only suspicious people

### 2. **Keypoint Extraction (normal.py & Suspicious.py)**  
- Uses YOLOv8-pose to extract 17 keypoints for each person  
- Saves cropped person images and body pose coordinates

### 3. **Dataset Generation (ImageShuffle.py & dataset.py)**  
- Moves images to labeled folders (`Normal/`, `Suspicious/`)  
- Creates a labeled dataset (`dataset.csv`) for model training

### 4. **Model Training (model.py)**  
- Trains an XGBoost classifier to distinguish between normal and suspicious behavior using body keypoints  
- Outputs `trained_model.json`

### 5. **Real-Time Prediction (main.py)**  
- Processes `vid.mp4`  
- Detects people with YOLOv8-pose  
- Classifies behavior using the trained XGBoost model  
- Annotates suspicious people in red, normal in green â†’ saves to `output_vid.mp4`

## Example Output

-  Bounding boxes labeled **"Suspicious"**  or **"Normal"**
-  Live video annotated and saved as `output_vid.mp4`
-  Console logs for predictions and detections per frame

##  Model Details

- **Pose Model**: `yolo11n-pose.pt`  
- **Classifier**: `XGBoost` (`binary:logistic`)  
- **Input Features**: 34 pose keypoints â†’ `x0â€“x16`, `y0â€“y16`  
- **Output Classes**:
  - `0` = **Suspicious**
  - `1` = **Normal**

## Use Case
Surveillance systems in malls, retail stores, and parking lots

Helps operators focus attention on real-time suspicious behavior

Can be expanded to detect loitering, abnormal postures, etc.
